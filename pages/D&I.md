***Diversity and Inclusion (D&I)*** are one of our fundamental goals. Like Openness, D&I is in the core of all of our activities. A large segment of our work will be identifying and mapping marginalized areas that need more attention so that we can build resources to provide support in the affected areas. We will be striving to make our work outcomes accessible to all along with making them open and reproducible.

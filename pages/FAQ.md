**1. What is O Foundation?**

The O Foundation is a nonprofit that uses digital technology in its core to make social innovations. With a focus on openness, diversity and inclusion, we are striving to transform the way millions of people have been accessing knowledge, and contributing to the knowledge commons. We ourselves being long time advocates and contributors to the Free/Libre and Open Source Software, and the Open Science movement, have been creating and bettering open source tools and educational resources that empower many marginalized grassroots communities—people with visual disability and illiteracy, speakers of indigenous/endangered languages, and people that have access to only low-end technology—to access the wealth of knowledge in their own language, preserve their native languages, and influence the narrative about themselves positively in a global scale. The Odia-language will be a focus language to begin with, but our work is going to be completely open and reproducible for others to build technology on the top of our work, and we will venture into more languages as the organization grows.
